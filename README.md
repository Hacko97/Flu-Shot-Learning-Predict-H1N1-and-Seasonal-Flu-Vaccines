- problem statement
  - A global pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus has wiped out the world reportedly nearly 3 lakhs deaths. A vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus became publicly available in October 2009. In late 2009 and early 2010, the United States conducted the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. This phone survey asked respondents whether they had received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with questions about themselves. These additional questions covered their social, economic, and demographic background, opinions on risks of illness and vaccine effectiveness, and behaviours towards mitigating transmission. A better understanding of how these characteristics are associated with personal vaccination patterns can provide guidance for future public health efforts. The goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, one must predict two probabilities: one for h1n1_vaccine and one for seasonal_vaccine. The performance will be evaluated according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) for each of the two target variables. The mean of these two scores will be the overall score. A higher value indicates stronger performance.
